# Learn and Be Curious Project Files

Welcome to your Learn and Be Curious Project Repository! As you already know, Learn and Be Curious is a unique experience from your other sprints here at Bloomtech. The most significant difference is that instead of being given a partially built project with mastery tasks that you need to complete, you will be creating a project from scratch, putting it onto AWS, and presenting your work.

We strongly recommend you review this repository's contents before you do any serious planning. Inside, you will find project requirements, templates, and guides that will help you get off to a great start. The requirements for your project are high-level by design. Your project should be unique and something you would be proud to share with others. 

## The Goal of this Project

The overarching goal of Learn and Be Curious is to use what you have learned so far, learn a new skill on your own, and build an incredible portfolio piece. The process of building your project will encapsulate all of those goals. By the end of this experience, you will have a project and experiences to lean on during your job search.
  
## How to Use this Repository

As we mentioned above, we first recommend becoming familiar with the contents of this repository. In it, you will find requirements and templates to help you get the most out of this experience. If you have questions about the requirements of this project, feel free to reach out to the instructor to get any clarification.

We've included in this project a starter project. This project contains a `build.gradle` file with many commonly used dependencies. Feel free to use this starter project or create your own.

Later, you will build a simple website that communicates with your project. We've included a few simple examples of web pages that you can refer to when building your website.

## Deadlines

All project deadlines can be found in the [rubric](project_documents/rubric.md).
  
## What Files are in This Repository?

#### [Design Document](project_documents/design_document.md)

The design document is what you need to complete before you start coding. This document lays out what you will be building and how you will build it, and the more you put into it, the easier your implementation will be.

#### [Project Rubric](project_documents/rubric.md)

The rubric contains the requirements for your project. You will fill out the rubric to show that your project successfully covers all the requirements.

#### [Final Presentation Outline](project_documents/final_presentation_outline.pdf)

This outline lays out what we expect to see in your final presentation. The outline is more of a guideline, so feel free to do things in a different order and put your style on your presentation. 

#### [Accomplishment Tracking](project_documents/accomplishment_tracking_template.md)

We encourage you to keep track of your accomplishments throughout your time in Learn and Be Curious. This experience will give you plenty to share during interviews, and having accomplishments written down will help you remember highlights you can share.

#### [Team Charter](project_documents/team_charter.md)

If you are working with a team, you must complete a team charter. This document will establish team norms and expectations, such as how you should communicate your work, how the team will create deadlines, what each person wants to get out of this experience, etc. Building your team charter will help your team work more effectively throughout this project.

#### [Reflection](project_documents/reflection.md)

You will complete your reflection in Canvas, but feel free to see what questions we may ask here.
