# Learn and Be Curious Project Files

Welcome to your Learn and Be Curious Project Repository! As you already know, Learn and Be Curious is a unique experience from your other sprints here at Bloomtech. The biggest difference is that instead of being given a partially built project with mastery tasks, you will be building a project from scratch and giving a presentation about your work. 

The project that you will be building has some requirements that you'll want to be aware of, so we strongly recommend that you review the contents of this repository first so that you can start planning your project. 

## Goal of this Project

The overarching goal of Learn and Be Curious is to use what you have learned so far, learn a new skill on your own, and build an incredible portfolio piece. The process of building your project will encapsulate all of those goals. By the end of this experience, you will have not only a project, but stories to share with recruiters and experiences that you can lean on in your job search and in your career. 
  
## How to Use this Repository

As we mentioned above, we first recommend becoming familiar with the contents of this repository. In it, you will find requirements and templates to help you get the most out of this experience. If you have any questions about the requirements either while you're reading through this repository or while you're building your project, feel free to reach out to the instructor to get any clarification you need. 

The next thing you'll want to be aware of is the template Java project. This project has no Java code, but it has a fleshed out `build.gradle` file with many common dependencies as a starting point for your project. You are not required to use the Java project, so feel free to genearate your own project if you'd like.

Later on, you'll be asked to build a simple website, and we've included an example of what that might look like. Use this example as a reference when it's time to build your website.

What you won't find in this repo is learning material. All that can be found in Canvas.

## Deadlines

All project deadlines can be found in the [rubric](project_documents/rubric.md).
  
## What Files are in This Repository?

#### [Design Document](project_documents/design_document.md)

The design document is what you need to complete before you start codeing. This document lays out what you will be building and how you will build it, and the more you put into it, the easier your implementation will be. 

#### [Project Rubric](project_documents/rubric.md)

The rubric contains the requirements for your project. You will fill out the rubric as a way to show that your project successfully covers all the requirements.

#### [Final Presentation Outline](project_documents/final_presentation_outline.pdf)

This outline lays out what we expect to see in your final presentation. The outline is more of a guideline, so feel free to do things in a different order and put your own style on your presentation. Make a presentation that shows off your project and yourself that you would be proud to share with others.

#### [Accomplishment Tracking](project_documents/accomplishment_tracking_template.md)

We encourage you to keep track of your accomplishments throughout your time in Learn and Be Curious. This experience will give you plenty to share during interviews, and having accomplishments written down will help you remember highlights that you can share.

#### [Team Charter](project_documents/team_charter.md)

If you are working with a team, you will need to fill out a team charter. This document will establish team norms and expectations, such as how should we communicate our work, how should we set deadlines, what does each person want to get out of this experience, etc. Building out your team charter will help your team work more effectively throughout this project.

#### [Reflection](project_documents/reflection.md)

You will complete your reflection in Canvas, but feel free to see what questions we may ask here.
